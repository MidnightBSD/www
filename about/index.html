					</div>

					<p>MidnightBSD is a FreeBSD derived Operating System. A critical goal of 
					the project is to create an easy to use desktop environment with graphical ports 
					management, and system configuration using GNUstep. The vast majority of the
					operating system will maintain a BSD license. Certain software packages use 
					other licenses such as X.org, GCC, and GNUstep.</p>
						
					<p>MidnightBSD was forked from FreeBSD 6.1 beta. The system was forked to allow
					us to customize and integrate the environment including the ports and system 
					configuration. We wish for the system to appeal to beginners as well as more 
					experienced BSD users. Many operating systems are under active development; 
					with MidnightBSD, we wish to focus on optimization and usability improvements
					for desktop users.</p>

					<p>The FreeBSD project has developed a reliable server operating environment,
					but often usability and performance on the desktop is overlooked. Scheduling, 
					allocation of resources, security settings, and available application support
					should be tailored to desktop users. Many of the BSD projects are tailored to 
					servers or older hardware. Others are distributions of FreeBSD with a nice 
					graphical user interface, but still suffer from server centric design under 
					the hood. We did not fork FreeBSD as a result of a falling out, but rather 
					as an excellent starting point. It should be viewed as a compliment to the
					FreeBSD developers who have worked very hard on FreeBSD 5.x and 6.x.</p>
					<p>We hope to create something unique. Project goals include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A new window and login manager. [Replaced by Etoile]</li>
						<li>Centralized system preferences while maintaining the BSD style on the command line.</li>
						<li>A graphical ports and package management system. Currently we use a 
						derivative of FreeBSD ports. [Now we have mports]</li>
						<li>Work on various portions of the kernel including syscons, process and 
						disk scheduling, imports of FreeBSD and OpenBSD drivers, etc.</li>
						<li>Importing useful features from DragonFly, OpenBSD and NetBSD.</li>
						<li>Improving security with little distraction to the end user. 
						[ipfw is enabled in 0.2+, sudo added, many other changes are coming]</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>MidnightBSD: Naming an OS</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Picking a name for MidnightBSD was challenging. Many domain names related to 
					BSD are in use by different parties. desktopbsd's domain had been purchased but 
					not up yet. My list of 35 names didn't last long when I started checking whois 
					records.</p>
					<p>After anything obvious for the desktop was taken, I decided to follow 
					DragonFly's idea of using a living element. Many stupid names came up like 
					SharkBSD, HammerHeadBSD, etc. I decided they sounded stupid. I thought of TigerBSD; 
					it sounded nice and I could think of some good themes for it. However, I was afraid a 
					certain fruit company would get upset with me. Finally, I decided to name MidnightBSD 
					after my first cat, Midnight.</p>
					<p>Newer logo designs feature a cat sitting on the moon. This was a compromise as so 
					many people hear the name and think of the time of day. The current logo on the
					website is a picture of Midnight's eyes. A newer logo design we've been playing 
					with is on cia.vc and the MidnightBSD Developer Blog.</p>
					<p>Also, a cat has a similar shape to the BSD daemon, and there is of course 
					the "cat" command.</p>
					<p>Midnight is ten years old. He's a black turkish angora with long hair and 
					gold eyes. When he was younger, he used to shutdown Netscape on me while I was 
					surfing to get attention on my old iMac (OS 9). He frequently sits on top of PCs and Macs.</p>
