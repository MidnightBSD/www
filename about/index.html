					</div>

					<p>MidnightBSD is a FreeBSD derived Operating System. A critical goal of 
					the project is to create an easy to use desktop environment with graphical ports 
					management, and system configuration using Xfce. The vast majority of the
					operating system will maintain a BSD license. Certain software packages use 
					other licenses such as X.org, GCC, and GNUstep.</p>
						
					<p>MidnightBSD was forked from FreeBSD 6.1 beta. The system was forked to allow
					us to customize and integrate the environment including the ports and system 
					configuration. We wish for the system to appeal to beginners as well as more 
					experienced BSD users. Many operating systems are under active development; 
					with MidnightBSD, we wish to focus on optimization and usability improvements
					for desktop users.</p>

					<p>The FreeBSD project has developed a reliable server operating environment,
					but often usability and performance on the desktop is overlooked. Scheduling, 
					allocation of resources, security settings, and available application support
					should be tailored to desktop users. Many of the BSD projects are tailored to 
					servers or older hardware. Others are distributions of FreeBSD with a nice 
					graphical user interface, but still suffer from server centric design under 
					the hood. We did not fork FreeBSD as a result of a falling out, but rather 
					as an excellent starting point. It should be viewed as a compliment to the
					FreeBSD developers who have worked very hard on FreeBSD 5.x and 6.x.</p>
					<p>We hope to create something unique. Project goals include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A new window and login manager. [Replaced by Etoile, then xfce + mlogind]</li>
						<li>Centralized system preferences while maintaining the BSD style on the command line.</li>
						<li>A graphical ports and package management system. Currently we use a 
						derivative of FreeBSD ports. [Now we have mports]</li>
						<li>Work on various portions of the kernel including syscons, process and 
						disk scheduling, imports of FreeBSD and OpenBSD drivers, etc.</li>
						<li>Importing useful features from DragonFly, MirBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD.</li>
						<li>Improving security with little distraction to the end user. 
						[ipfw is enabled in 0.2+, sudo added, many other changes are coming]</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>2015 Update</h3>
					<p>Later versions of MidnightBSD synced large bits from newer FreeBSD releases. 0.3 included code
					from FreeBSD 7 and 0.5 included a large sync from FreeBSD 9.1 release. MidnightBSD now targets
					i386 and amd64 (x86_64) based computers and includes all hardware supported in FreeBSD 9.1 plus
					additional devices.</p>
					<p>MidnightBSD also includes ZFS, hast, UFS2 journaling, SSD TRIM, Perl, mDNSResponder, OpenSSH,
					and a slew of other things.</p>
					<h3>2021 Update</h3>
					<p>We switched from GNUstep + Window Maker + GWorkspace to Xfce as our desktop environment. We still plan to maintain
					support for GNUstep environments as much as possible, but it's much easier to do integration with Xfce. 
					<p>MidnightBSD 2.x incorporates major features of FreeBSD 11-stable now including bhyve, updated GPU support, and toolchain.
					<p>We're now including a default .xinitrc and updated the midnightbsd-desktop pacakge to include basics for a desktop. Work is
					continuing on the package manager to support installs from the installer rather than the firstboot rc.d script.
					<p>We've imported doas from OpenBSD to replace sudo.

				<h3>MidnightBSD: Naming an OS</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Picking a name for MidnightBSD was challenging. Many domain names related to 
					BSD are in use by different parties. desktopbsd's domain had been purchased but 
					not up yet. My list of 35 names didn't last long when I started checking whois 
					records.</p>
					<p>After anything obvious for the desktop was taken, I decided to follow 
					DragonFly's idea of using a living element. Many stupid names came up like 
					SharkBSD, HammerHeadBSD, etc. I decided they sounded stupid. I thought of TigerBSD; 
					it sounded nice and I could think of some good themes for it. However, I was afraid a 
					certain fruit company would get upset with me. Finally, I decided to name MidnightBSD 
					after my first cat, Midnight.</p>
					<p>Newer logo designs feature a cat sitting on the moon. This was a compromise as so 
					many people hear the name and think of the time of day. The previous logo on the
					website was a picture of Midnight's eyes.</p>
					<p>Also, a cat has a similar shape to the BSD daemon, and there is of course 
					the "cat" command.</p>
					<p>Midnight was a black turkish angora with long hair and
					gold eyes. When he was younger, he used to shutdown Netscape on me while I was 
					surfing to get attention on my old iMac (OS 9). He frequently sat on top of PCs and Macs. He passed away
					during the summer of 2015 after a battle with cancer.</p>
