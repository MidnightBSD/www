					<p>A vulnerability in ftpd could allow unauthorized access.  This is network exploitable and affects all versions of MidnightBSD.
				 	<br>CVE-2008-4247<br>
					Update your system using cvs to RELENG_0_2 or apply the patch on the ftp server in pub/MidnightBSD/patches/0.2.1/patch-ftpd and
					rebuild ftpd.

					<h3>Septmeber 4, 2008</h3>
					<p>An issue has been reported on systems running MidnightBSD for amd64/emt64 processors.  (in 64bit os)  This patch was released AFTER
					0.2.1-RELEASE.  Update systems to RELENG_0_2 or CURRENT to get the fix.
					From the FreeBSD advisory on the same issue: If a General Protection Fault happens on a FreeBSD/amd64 system while
					it is returning from an interrupt, trap or system call, the swapgs CPU
					instruction may be called one extra time when it should not resulting
					in userland and kernel state being mixed.
					</p>

				<blockquote class="bluebox" id="a20080610">
					<h3>July 11, 2008</h3>
					<p>Update to bind 9.4.1 p1 to fix the recently reported vulnerability in most dns software. Users
					   of BIND are recommended to update to the latest version in src on RELENG_0_2 or CURRENT, or
					   to obtain a newer version from mports.</p>

				<blockquote class="bluebox" id="a20080516">
					<h3>May 16, 2008</h3>
					<p>The Debian project made a patch to openssl causing a defect in the generation of ssh keys.  A new
					utility was added to midnightbsd to detect these keys and deny them.  This was applied to RELENG_0_2 and
					CURRENT. The utility was obtained from Ubuntu.</p>

					<p>A security issue was found with strfmon in libc.  
				 	 <a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-1391">CVE-2008-1391</a> Integer Overflow.

				<blockquote class="bluebox" id="a20080215"> 
			 		<h3>February 15, 2008</h3>
					<p>
				 	CURRENT now has a patch to correct a potential security issue with sendfile. Files were not checked prior to serving which would allow a file that was write only to be served. While this scenario is rare, we decided to fix it anyway. 
				 	<br />
				 	sendfile is used by many daemons including Apache httpd.

				<blockquote class="bluebox" id="a20070801">
					<h3>August 1, 2007</h3>
					<p>BIND and Tcpdump were patched in 0.2 and 0.1 for recent security issues. BIND is now equivalent to 9.3.4p1.</p>

				<blockquote class="bluebox" id="a20070502">
					<h3>May 2, 2007</h3>

				<blockquote class="bluebox" id="a20070310">
					<h3>March 10, 2007</h3>
					<p>While many of the DST changes were imported last year, we decided to cover all cases and import the latest tzdata2007c. Users concerned about DST changes should update their sources and rebuild. The java ports may not have DST changes in place. We will review that issue.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="bluebox" id="a20070132">
					<h3>January 23, 2007</h3>
					<p>A "symlink" exploit was found in the MidnightBSD jail system. A fix was made available. Please update your /etc/rc.d/jail file from cvs. Patches will not be created until our first release.</p>
