<h2>0.1.1-RELEASE Notes</h2>

<p>
<strong>November 9, 2007</strong>  
We're happy to announce the release of MidnightBSD 0.1.1. The software is 
available on our FTP server and will be on the mirrors shortly. 

The packages for 0.1.1 are on the FTP server, but the Latest and category 
symlinks have not been put in place on the FTP server yet. You can manually
download packages to use with pkg_add or give it an exact url to the file
with pkg_add -r We're planning on fixing this in a few days. These packages 
were generated on our new mports build cluster called magus. There were near 
1000 packages generated for this release on i386. 

I'm planning on making an amd64 release, but have not started that build
yet. It will probably be another week before that is done as I have to build 
packages too. 

What's new: 

Updated to bzip2 1.04 

mports collection is included with the release. This greatly simplifies 
getting additional software for MidnightBSD. 

OpenSSL security issue corrected. 

libpthread output intended as an error is written to stderr instead of stdout. 

find has new "birth" time options. 

pkg_install tools like pkg_add know about mports. 


Late breaking information: 

This release includes x.org 6.9. It will be the last release with x.org 6.9. 
Users who want to use x.org 7.3 should update their mports tree and uninstall 
all ports depending on X11. It is recommended that you delete /usr/X11R6 
and create a symlink to /usr/local for /usr/X11R6. This will allow all 
the ports to work. The updated ports tree has many new software packages
including most of Gnome 2.18.3. Since this mports tree was created (0.1.1's), 
over 300 ports were added to MidnightBSD. 1500 ports are building correctly 
on our build cluster. 

Special Thanks: 

Eastern Michigan University's Computer Science Department donated the 
computing resources for the magus build cluster. This allowed us to build 
packages in 10 hours for this release. 

The next release: 

0.2 will be the next release barring any need for a later 0.1.x release. It will 
include replacements for pkg_add and a new installer option. Expect it in 2008.
