					OpenSSL failes to clear the bytes used as block cipher padding in SSL 3.0 records when operating as a client or a server that accept SSL 3.0 handshakes. As a result, in each record, up to 15 bytes of uninitialized memory may be sent, encrypted, to the SSL peer. This could include sensitive contents of previously freed memory. [CVE-2011-4576] 
				</p>
				<p>
					OpenSSL support for handshake restarts for server gated cryptograpy (SGC) can be used in a denial-of-service attack. [CVE-2011-4619]
				</p>
				<p>
					If an application uses OpenSSL's certificate policy checking when verifying X509 certificates, by enabling the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag, a policy check failure can lead to a double-free. [CVE-2011-4109] 
				</p>
				<p>
					A weakness in the OpenSSL PKCS #7 code can be exploited using Bleichenbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 RSA padding also known as the million message attack (MMA). [CVE-2012-0884]
				</p>
				<p>
					The asn1_d2i_read_bio() function, used by the d2i_*_bio and d2i_*_fp functions, in OpenSSL contains multiple integer errors that can cause memory corruption when parsing encoded ASN.1 data. This error can occur on systems that parse untrusted ASN.1 data, such as X.509 certificates or RSA public keys. [CVE-2012-2110]

					0.3-PRERELEASE and 0.4-CURRENT have an issue in all pseudofs based file systems including procfs and linprocfs that either can be used to run code as the kernel or at best crash the system. It's important to update the kernel on systems affected.
