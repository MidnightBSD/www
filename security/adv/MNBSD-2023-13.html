<h1>MNBSD-2023-13 TCP spoofing vulnerability in pf(4)</h1>
<p>An attacker can, with relatively little effort, inject packets into a TCP stream destined to a host behind a pf firewall.  This could be used to implement a denial-of-service attack for hosts behind the firewall, for example by sending TCP RST packets to the host.</p>
