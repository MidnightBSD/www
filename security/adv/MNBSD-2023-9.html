<h1>MNBSD-2023-9 OpenSSH ssh-agent insecure search path</h1>
<p>The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.</p>

<p>Aliases: CVE-2023-38408</p>
