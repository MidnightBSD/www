<h1>MNBSD-2023-12 OpenSSH row hammer attack</h1>
<p>OpenSSH through 9.6, when common types of DRAM are used, might allow row hammer attacks (for authentication bypass) because the integer value of authenticated in mm_answer_authpassword does not resist flips of a single bit. NOTE this is applicable to a certain threat model of attacker-victim co-location in which the attacker has user privileges.</p>

<p>Aliases: CVE-2023-51767</p>
