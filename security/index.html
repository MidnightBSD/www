					<p>OpenSSL failes to clear the bytes used as block cipher padding in SSL 3.0
					records when operating as a client or a server that accept SSL 3.0
					handshakes.  As a result, in each record, up to 15 bytes of uninitialized
					memory may be sent, encrypted, to the SSL peer.  This could include
					sensitive contents of previously freed memory. [CVE-2011-4576]
					</p>
					<p>OpenSSL support for handshake restarts for server gated cryptograpy (SGC)
					can be used in a denial-of-service attack. [CVE-2011-4619]</p>

					<p>If an application uses OpenSSL's certificate policy checking when
					verifying X509 certificates, by enabling the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK
					flag, a policy check failure can lead to a double-free. [CVE-2011-4109]
					</p>

					<p>A weakness in the OpenSSL PKCS #7 code can be exploited using
					Bleichenbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 RSA padding also known as the
					million message attack (MMA). [CVE-2012-0884]</p>

					<p>The asn1_d2i_read_bio() function, used by the d2i_*_bio and d2i_*_fp
					functions, in OpenSSL contains multiple integer errors that can cause
					memory corruption when parsing encoded ASN.1 data.  This error can occur
					on systems that parse untrusted ASN.1 data, such as X.509 certificates
					or RSA public keys. [CVE-2012-2110]

					<p>Multiple security vulnerabilities impacting 0.3-RELEASE and 0.4-CURRENT have been patched in
					MidnightBSD.</p>

					<ul>
					<li>telnetd: fix a root exploit from a fixed buffer that was not checked</li>
					<li>pam: don't allow escape from policy path.  Exploitable in KDE, etc.</li>
					<li>Fix pam_ssh module: If the pam_ssh module is enabled, attackers may be able to gain access
						to user accounts which have unencrypted SSH private keys.</li>
					<li>Fix security issue with chroot and ftpd.</li>
					<li>nsdispatch(3) doesn't know it's working in a chroot and some
						operations can cause files to get reloaded causing a security
						hole in things like ftpd.</li>
					</ul>
