					<h3>January 10, 2009</h3>
					<p>Fix two issues with MidnightBSD 0.2.1 and 0.3-CURRENT.  The first is in OpenSSL and would allow applications that use OpenSSL to interpret an
					invalid certificate as valid. The second is in lukemftpd(8)
					that could allow long commands to be split into multiple commands.</p>

					<h3>December 31, 2008</h3>
					<p>Correct a problem where bluetooth and netgraph sockets were not initialized properly.  This is available in RELENG_0_2, RELENG_0_1, and current.</p>

				<blockquote class="bluebox" id="a20081124">
					<h3>November 24, 2008</h3>
					<p>Correct a problem in arc4random which causes the device not to get enough entropy for system services. Â Geom classes initialized at startup will still have problems.  Update your system to

				 	<br>CVE-2008-4247<br>
					Update your system using cvs to RELENG_0_2 or apply the patch on the ftp server in pub/MidnightBSD/patches/0.2.1/patch-ftpd and

					<h3>Septmeber 4, 2008</h3>
					<p>An issue has been reported on systems running MidnightBSD for amd64/emt64 processors.  (in 64bit os)  This patch was released AFTER
					0.2.1-RELEASE.  Update systems to RELENG_0_2 or CURRENT to get the fix.
					From the FreeBSD advisory on the same issue: If a General Protection Fault happens on a FreeBSD/amd64 system while
					it is returning from an interrupt, trap or system call, the swapgs CPU
					instruction may be called one extra time when it should not resulting
					in userland and kernel state being mixed.

					<h3>July 11, 2008</h3>
					<p>Update to bind 9.4.1 p1 to fix the recently reported vulnerability in most dns software. Users
					   of BIND are recommended to update to the latest version in src on RELENG_0_2 or CURRENT, or
					   to obtain a newer version from mports.</p>

				<blockquote class="bluebox" id="a20080516">
					<h3>May 16, 2008</h3>
					<p>The Debian project made a patch to openssl causing a defect in the generation of ssh keys.  A new
					utility was added to midnightbsd to detect these keys and deny them.  This was applied to RELENG_0_2 and
					CURRENT. The utility was obtained from Ubuntu.</p>

			 		<h3>February 15, 2008</h3>
					<p>
				 	CURRENT now has a patch to correct a potential security issue with sendfile. Files were not checked prior to serving which would allow a file that was write only to be served. While this scenario is rare, we decided to fix it anyway. 
				 	<br />
				 	sendfile is used by many daemons including Apache httpd.
