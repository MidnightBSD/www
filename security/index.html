	<p>0.5.10 RELEASE

	<p>OpenSSL Security update

	<p>A malformed elliptic curve private key file could cause a use-after-free
	condition in the d2i_ECPrivateKey function.  [CVE-2015-0209]

	<p>An attempt to compare ASN.1 boolean types will cause the ASN1_TYPE_cmp
	function to crash with an invalid read.  [CVE-2015-0286]

	<p>Reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing may allow an attacker to cause memory
	corruption via an invalid write. [CVE-2015-0287]

	<p>The function X509_to_X509_REQ will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if
	the certificate key is invalid.  [CVE-2015-0288]

	<p>The PKCS#7 parsing code does not handle missing outer ContentInfo correctly.
	[CVE-2015-0289]

	<p>A malicious client can trigger an OPENSSL_assert in servers that both support
	SSLv2 and enable export cipher suites by sending a specially crafted SSLv2
	CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message.  [CVE-2015-0293]

	<p>0.5.9 RELEASE

	<p>Fix two security vulnerabilities. 

	<p>1. BIND servers which are configured to perform DNSSEC validation and which
	are using managed keys (which occurs implicitly when using
	"dnssec-validation auto;" or "dnssec-lookaside auto;") may exhibit
	unpredictable behavior due to the use of an improperly initialized
	variable.

	<p>CVE-2015-1349

	<p>2. An integer overflow in computing the size of IGMPv3 data buffer can result
	in a buffer which is too small for the requested operation.

	<p>This can result in a DOS attack.

	<h3>January 14, 2015</h3>
	<p>0.5.8 RELEASE

	<p>Fix several security issues with OpenSSL.

	<p>A carefully crafted DTLS message can cause a segmentation fault in OpenSSL
	due to a NULL pointer dereference. [CVE-2014-3571]

	<p>A memory leak can occur in the dtls1_buffer_record function under certain
	conditions. [CVE-2015-0206]

	<p>When OpenSSL is built with the no-ssl3 option and a SSL v3 ClientHello is
	received the ssl method would be set to NULL which could later result in
	a NULL pointer dereference.  [CVE-2014-3569]

	<p>An OpenSSL client will accept a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH
	ciphersuite using an ECDSA certificate if the server key exchange message
	is omitted. [CVE-2014-3572]

	<p>An OpenSSL client will accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export
	RSA key exchange ciphersuite. [CVE-2015-0204]

	<p>An OpenSSL server will accept a DH certificate for client authentication
	without the certificate verify message. [CVE-2015-0205]

	<p>OpenSSL accepts several non-DER-variations of certificate signature
	algorithm and signature encodings.  OpenSSL also does not enforce a
	match between the signature algorithm between the signed and unsigned
	portions of the certificate. [CVE-2014-8275]

	<p>Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some
	platforms, including x86_64. [CVE-2014-3570]

					<h3>October 21, 2014</h3>
					<p>0.5.3-RELEASE</p>

					<p>MidnightBSD 0.5.3-RELEASE is now available via subversion. 

<p>Fix several security vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, routed, rtsold,
and namei with respect to Capsicum sandboxes looking up
nonexistent path names and leaking memory.

<p>OpenSSL update adds some workarounds for the recent
poodle vulnerability reported by Google.

<p>The input path in routed(8) will accept queries from any source and
attempt to answer them.  However, the output path assumes that the
destination address for the response is on a directly connected
network.

<p>Due to a missing length check in the code that handles DNS parameters,
a malformed router advertisement message can result in a stack buffer
overflow in rtsold(8).

<p>In addition, we've released 0.5.2-RELEASE ISOs on the FTP server for both amd64 and i386. 
We plan to do rollup security releases periodically.

					<p>nullfs(5)</p>

        			<p>The nullfs(5) implementation of the VOP_LINK(9) VFS operation does not
        			check whether the source and target of the link are both in the same
        			nullfs instance.  It is therefore possible to create a hardlink from a
       				location in one nullfs instance to a file in another, as long as the
       				underlying (source) filesystem is the same.</p>

        			<p>ifioctl</p>

        			<p>As is commonly the case, the IPv6 and ATM network layer ioctl request
        			handlers are written in such a way that an unrecognized request is
        			passed on unmodified to the link layer, which will either handle it or
        			return an error code.</p>

        			<p>
        			Network interface drivers, however, assume that the SIOCSIFADDR,
        			SIOCSIFBRDADDR, SIOCSIFDSTADDR and SIOCSIFNETMASK requests have been
        			handled at the network layer, and therefore do not perform input
        			validation or verify the caller's credentials.  Typical link-layer
        			actions for these requests may include marking the interface as "up"
        			and resetting the underlying hardware.
