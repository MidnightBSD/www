            Cookies are small data files that a website you visit may save on your computer
            or handheld device that usually includes an anonymous unique identifier. Our Websites

            your preferences, promotional campaigns, tracking our audience size and traffic
            patterns, and in certain other cases. We may include small graphic images in our
            email messages and newsletters to determine whether the messages were opened and
            the links were viewed.

            Third-party advertisers may also create and access cookies, which will be subject
            to their privacy policies – we accept no responsibility or liability for the use
            of such third parties’ cookies. If you do not wish cookies to be placed on your

            to do so is normally found in your browser’s “security settings” section. Please
            note that permanently disabling cookies in your browser may hinder your use of
            our Websites as well as other websites and interactive services.

            systems to protect data
            transmissions. However, this is not a guarantee that such data transmissions
            cannot be accessed, altered or deleted due to firewall or other
            security software failures.
