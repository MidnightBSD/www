        <h3>(02/02/2019) MidnightBSD 1.1</h3>


        <p>Iâ€™m happy to announce the availability of MidnightBSD 1.1 for amd64 and i386.  This is a minor release to fix
            a few hardware and security issues that have come up since the 1.0 release.
            It is strongly recommended that you upgrade, particularly if you have newer Intel hardware.
        </p>

        <p>This release also includes a new version of OpenSSL.  This is a move from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2p in base. Many
            mports are built with a package and will likely not be affected. It is still recommended that you rebuild
            any mports using SSL or update the packages as appropriate.

        <p>OpenSSH was also updated and removes support for older SSH v1 connections.

        <p>A bug fix for ICMP underwrites is included. The icmp_error routine allocates either an mbuf or a cluster
        depending on the size of the data to be quoted in the ICMP reply, but the calculation failed to account for
        additional padding on 64-bit platforms when using a non-default sysctl value for net.inet.icmp.quotelen.

        <p>Perl 5.28.0 fixes a number of security issues present in the older 5.26 version included with 1.0.

        <h4>3rd party software</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>ACPICA 20170728
            <li>Perl 5.28.0
            <li>mksh R56c
            <li>OpenSSH 7.5p1
            <li>OpenSSL 1.0.2p
        </ul>

        <h4>Hardware</h4>
        Add the ability to disable TRIM on specific controllers or drives that have bugs. This includes some ASMedia
        controllers using on AMD hardware.

        <p>Several bugs with Intel em(4) and igb(4) network card drivers have been fixed.

        - Or in the DMA coalescing Rx threshold so the other bits set in E1000_DMACR
        remain intact as intended in igb_init_dmac(). [1]
        - Fix igb corrupting checksums with BPF and VLAN

        <p>Fix MSI-X to properly fail allocations when full. The off-by-one errors in 332735 weren't actual errors and
        were preventing the last MSI interrupt source from being used.</p>

        <h4>Mport Package Manager</h4>
        <p>Introduced new setting to set the mirror region you wish to use. Currently, we have two mirrors including
            the main site in Ypsilanti, MI and another in Japan.</p>
        <code>
            mport config get mirror_region
            mport config set mirror_region jp
        </code>

        <h4>Known Issues</h4>
        <p>There is a known issue with scp in OpenSSH.  While this version does not fix the issue, it is new enough that
            we expect to be able to release a patch for it soon.  We chose to release anyway due to issues with OpenSSL and Perl.

        <p>Several issues were reported with the 1.0 release an the LiveCD functionality. These have not been corrected
        yet. We recommend installing MidnightBSD in a virtual machine to try it out before committing to dedicated hardware with it.

        <p>At the time of release, several packages are still getting updated in mports. Initial package availability
        will be limited, but we expect better support going forward.

        <p>mports/devel/p5-version must be updated in order to work with the system perl.


        <p>If you are updating an existing system, after installing 1.1,
            you can use mport upgrade to update packages with 1.1 versions. It is recommended that you delete
            /usr/mports/Packages and
            run mport clean to remove old package remnants.

        <p>You may use svnlite (part of the base system) to checkout mports or src, if you do not wish to install the
            svn package.

            <br>e.g.
            <br>cd /usr/ && svnlite co http://svn.midnightbsd.org/svn/mports/trunk mports
        </p>
