        <h3>(03/23/2023) MidnightBSD 3.0</h3>

        <p>I’m happy to announce the availability of MidnightBSD 3.0 for amd64 and i386.  This release includes several larger enhancements imported from FreeBSD 12 stable.</p>

        <h4>Upgrade Process</h4>

        <p>Install git if you don’t have it already<br>
        <code>mport install git</code>
        </p>

        <p>Fetch MidnightBSD from git via github.com/midnightbsd/src.git   (assumes you don’t have /usr/src populated)

        <p>
        <code>git clone -b stable/3.0 https://github.com/MidnightBSD/src.git</code>
        </p>

        <p>NOTE: some users have experienced build errors on 2.x which require disabling perl in usr.bin/Makefile at the top and
       removing camcontrol and df from the rescue/rescue/Makefile temporarily.  You can build these once on 3.x.  We are
       investigating the issue.</p>

        <p>
        <code>cd /usr/src; make -j4 clean buildworld buildkernel;<br>
        mergemaster -p<br>
        make installkernel<br>
            reboot</code>
        </p>

        <p>(if it works OK, login and go to /usr/src)<br>
            <code>
            make installworld<br>
        mergemaster -iU<br>
            </code>
        </p>

        <p>
        Update installed mports/packages<br>
        For mport package manager, run
        <code>
            mport index<br>
            mport clean<br>
            mport upgrade<br>
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>Remove old libraries and programs from the base.</p>
        <p><code>
            cd /usr/src/; make check-old; make delete-old; make installworld;
        </code>
        </p>

        <h4>Known Issues</h4>

        <p>There are known issues with the firefox, chromium-bin, midori and epiphany web browser packages and mports
        that need to be corrected.  (detected late, sorry)  Issues were created on github in mports repo to track these. (mesa issue, see below)</p>

        <p>i386 and amd64 packages are available, but there was an issue with our mesa version. It has been updated in mports
        but new packages haven't been built yet. </p>

        <p>When upgrading from a previous release, be sure to get on at least MidnightBSD 2.2.5 before jumping to 3.0.
            There are issues with usr.bin/lex on some systems.</p>

        <p>When doing a major upgrade from 2.x to 3.x, sometimes it's necessary to disable
            perl builds in usr.bin/Makefile. If you get an error with buildworld in src/rescue/rescue, try removing
            camcontrol and df from the makefile temporarily.  Once on 3.x, you can rebuild the src/rescue/rescue and src/usr.bin/perl
        directories with make && make install.  </p>

        <p>On some AMD Ryzen systems, there is a time skew under high load or with heavy virtualization workloads.  If you notice this issue, try changing the default kern.eventtimer.timer.
        HPET sometimes helps. </p>
