            <li>serf 1.3.9
            <li>subversion 1.8.10
        </ul>

        <h3>(01/13/2017) MidnightBSD 0.8.5-RELEASE</h3>

        <p>0.8.5 is a minor update for MidnightBSD 0.8 that includes all security patches, mport package manager bug
            fixes and
            OpenSSH update. See the security pages for more details on individual security issues addressed.</p>

        <h3>(08/14/2016) MidnightBSD 0.8-RELEASE</h3>

        <p>MidnightBSD 0.8 includes several enhancements to the system. We switched system compilers from GCC 4.2 to
            llvm/clang 3.3 with plans to update to newer versions. We’re making use of libdispatch in our package
            manager. Several longstanding bugs with the mports framework have been fixed.

        <h4>Security</h4>
        <h5>Kernel</h5>

        <p>The implementation of TIOCGSERIAL ioctl(2) does not clear the output struct before sending to userland in the
            linux emulation layer.

        <p>The compat 43 stat(2) system call exposes kernel stack to userland.


        <p>atkbd(4) - Incorrect signedness comparison in the ioctl(2) handler allows a malicious
            local user to overwrite a portion of the kernel memory.

        <p>Incorrect argument handling in sendmsg(2)

        <p>Incorrect argument handling in the socket code allows malicious local user to overwrite large portion of the
            kernel memory.

        <p>A special combination of sysarch(2) arguments, specify a request to
            uninstall a set of descriptors from the LDT. The start descriptor
            is cleared and the number of descriptors are provided. Due to invalid
            use of a signed intermediate value in the bounds checking during argument
            validity verification, unbound zero'ing of the process LDT and adjacent
            memory can be initiated from usermode.

        <p>TCP MD5 signature denial of service

        <p>A programming error in processing a TCP connection with both TCP_MD5SIG and TCP_NOOPT socket options may lead
            to kernel crash.

        <p>SCTP

        <p>A lack of proper input checks in the ICMPv6 processing in the SCTP stack can lead to either a failed kernel
            assertion or to a NULL pointer dereference. In either case, a kernel panic will follow.

        <p>libarchive
        <p>CVE-2015-2304 and CVE-2013-0211 fix issues with cpio directory traversal and an integer signedness error in
            the archive write zip data routine.

        <p>OpenSSL
        <p>The padding check in AES-NI CBC MAC was rewritten to be in constant time
            by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against
            either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was
            enough data to have both the MAC and padding bytes. [CVE-2016-2107]

        <p>An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for
            Base64 encoding of binary data. [CVE-2016-2105]

        <p>An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function, however it is believed that there can be no
            overflows in internal code due to this problem. [CVE-2016-2106]

        <p>When ASN.1 data is read from a BIO using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio() a short invalid encoding can cause
            allocation of large amounts of memory potentially consuming excessive resources or exhausting
            memory.[CVE-2016-2109]

        <p>The signature verification routines will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if presented with an ASN.1
            signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and absent mask generation function parameter. [CVE-2015-3194]

        <p>When presented with a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure, OpenSSL will leak memory. [CVE-2015-3195]

        <p> If PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client then the values are incorrectly updated in the
            parent SSL_CTX structure. [CVE-2015-3196]

        <p>OpenSSH
        <p>Fix a security issue with OpenSSH X11 forwarding that can allow an attacker run shell commands on the call to
            xauth.

        <p>bsnmpd
        <p>Fix security on bsnmpd configuration file during installation.

        <h4>Enhancements</h4>
        <p>top now displays information on ZFS arc cache.

        <p>llvm + clang 3.3 is now the default compiler in MidnightBSD.

        <p>Introduce pipe2 to linux emulation layer.

        <p>Increase kern.ipc.somaxconn default to 256.

        <p>In rpcbind(8), netbuf structures are copied directly, which would result in
            two netbuf structures that reference to one shared address buffer. When one
            of the two netbuf structures is freed, access to the other netbuf structure
            would result in an undefined result that may crash the rpcbind(8) daemon.

        <p>Fix kqueue write events for files > 2GB

        <p>libdispatch is now configured to use the blocks runtime.
            Removed Features
            This may be the last release with i386 support. We’re considering dropping it and focusing on amd64 as most
            modern PCs are 64 bit capable.

        <p>P4tcc is now disabled by default. You can edit the device.hints file to turn this back on. This will result
            in no CPU frequency changing features on old devices, but it causes less confusion on modern CPUs. If you
            notice that your CPU is not detecting frequency, turn this back on to allow powerd to scale.

        <h4>New Software Versions</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>>SQLite 3.11.1
            <li>OpenPAM Micrampelis
        </ul>

        <h4>mports & Package Tools</h4>

        <p>mport and libmport is now multithreaded and makes use of the libdispatch library and Blocks runtime.

        <p>Add initial statistics api to libmport and a driver to print it in mport(1).

        <p>libmport now supports @preexec, @postexec, @preunexec and @postunexec to replace @exec and @unexec.

        <p>pre exec runs afer pre-install scripts but before actual installation. post exec runs after install but
            before post install scripts and pkg message. pre unexec runs before pre uninstall scripts post unexec runs
            before de-install scripts and after file removal.

        <p>Several issues have been fixed with package installation including better error handling and reporting to
            failures, fixes to @sample and @(root,wheel,4555) permissions handling, and optimizations to upgrading
            databases, initialization and the configuration of the sqlite3 databases with respect to performance.
            Installs should be significantly quicker as a result.

        <p>There is one known issue. The @mode with no parameters is currently causing crashes. While this only affects
            a small number of ports, it will be fixed in a future update to the stable branch some time after release.
            Packages
        <p>A significant amount of work went into fixing bugs with the mports framework and the package manager in this
            release. We now have over 3,000 ports. QT5 went in just after packages were built for the release.

        <p>There are 2600 packages available for i386 and about 1800 for amd64 currently. We’re planning on rolling new
            packages for amd64 soon. An issue with the package manager delayed the release and caused failures during
            the amd64 build. This bug has been fixed, but there wasn’t time to update packages before the release went
            out. This means desktop environments were not fully built for amd64 yet, but will be available in the next
            few days.

        <p>Notable mports to try:

        <ul>
            <li>mlogind is the new MidnightBSD login manager. It’s based on slim with some customizations and bug fixes.
                The code is on github.

            <li>Mport manager - a graphical front end to MidnightBSD’s package manager

            <li>Lumina desktop environment (there is no package for this yet).

            <li>Xfce 4.12
            <li>Gnome 3.16.2
        </ul>

        <p>Note: this release is a little weak on packages and that will be corrected over time.
            Many ports actually work if you build from source such as ruby, gnome 3, node/npm, etc.
            We also made progress on the openjdk 6 port. It’s not working with some software, most notably
            Tomcat but you can run some desktop applications on it.


        <p>If you are updating an existing system, after installing 0.8,
            you can use mport upgrade to update packages with 0.8 versions. It is recommended that you delete
            /usr/mports/Packages and
            run mport clean to remove old package remnants.

        <p>You may use svnlite (part of the base system) to checkout mports or src, if you do not wish to install the
            svn package.

            <br>e.g.
            <br>cd /usr/ && svnlite co http://svn.midnightbsd.org/svn/mports/trunk mports
          </p>
