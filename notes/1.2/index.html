            <h4>Late breaking information:</h4>
            <blockquote>
                There have been several issues identified post the 1.2 RELEASE including
                bugs in mport package manager that prevent installation or set incorrect
                permissions, security issues (described on security page), and a bug
                with the NFSv4 server that can result in crashes.

                Recommended to update to the 1.2-stable branch.

                In addition, we migrated from SVN to Git after the release. Be sure
                to fetch updates from Github.

		1.2.7 - Fix bugs in USB stack, mport package manager, and multiple security issues. (see security page)
		1.2.8 - Fix security vulnerability in dhclient

        <h3>(10/31/2019) MidnightBSD 1.2</h3>

        <p>Iâ€™m happy to announce the availability of MidnightBSD 1.2 for amd64 and i386. This release
            focused on updating base system libraries and security. A significant effort has been put into
            updating various mports.
        </p>

        <p>Portsnap is now included in the base system.  You can use it to fetch mports. As this is a relatively
        new feature, please report any issues.</p>

        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        
        <p>Fixed spell(1) by bringing back deroff(1).</p>
        
        <p>Fixed a bug with the mdnsd startup script (/etc/rc.d/mdnsd) where it wouldn't modify the
        /etc/nsswitch.conf properly when enabling mDNSresponder.</p>

        <h4>Security fixes</h4>

        <p> The kernel driver for /dev/midistat implements a handler for read(2).
            This handler is not thread-safe, and a multi-threaded program can
            exploit races in the handler to cause it to copy out kernel memory
            outside the boundaries of midistat's data buffer.
        </p>
        <p>
            System calls operating on file descriptors obtain a reference to
            relevant struct file which due to a programming error was not always put
            back, which in turn could be used to overflow the counter of affected
            struct file.
        </p>

        <p>
            Security patch for CVE-2019-5611.<br>

            Due do a missing check in the code of m_pulldown(9) data returned may not be
            contiguous as requested by the caller.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fix some buffer overflows in telnet client<br>

            The code which handles a close(2) of a descriptor created by
            posix_openpt(2) fails to undo the configuration which causes SIGIO to be
            raised. This bug can lead to a write-after-free of kernel memory.
            <br>
            Due to insufficient initialization of memory copied to userland in the
            components listed above small amounts of kernel memory may be disclosed
            to userland processes.

        </p>
        
        <h4>3rd party software</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>OpenSSH 7.9p1
            <li>bzip2 1.0.7
        </ul>

        <p>
            bsnmp bug fix - A function extracting the length from type-length-value encoding is not properly validating
            the submitted length.
        </p>

        <h4>Hardware</h4>

        <p>jedec_dimm - some modules falsely report supporting temp sensors. Handle this
            better.

        <p>Some work was also completed on the USB stack.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add some quirks for sandisk sdcz48_32 ultra 32gb, ploytec spl crimson rev 1, edirol ua-25ex</li>
            <li>Fix for reception of large full speed isochronous frames via the transaction translator.
            <li>In xhci(4) there is no stream ID in the completion TRB. instead interate all the stream idds in stream mode to find the matching USB transfer.</li>
            <li>Fix a lost completion event issue towards libusb(3).</li>
            <li>Reduce timeout for reading the USB HUB port status to 1000ms and try to filter out dead USB HUB devices by implemention of an error counter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Mport Package Manager</h4>

        <p>Several bug fixes to existing SQL queries were done in this release. It should improve lookups of
            packages when searching or installing updates. Error handling improvements were also done.</p>

        <p>Some bug fixes around absolute paths should improve installation when plists contain absoluate paths.</p>

        <p>You may choose an alternate package mirror location by setting the configuration after install.</p>

        <p>Lookup current setting:
            <code>
                mport config get mirror_region
            </code>

        <p>Set the a new mirror location:
            <code>
                mport config set mirror_region jp
            </code>

        <h4>Known Issues</h4>

        <p>Several issues were reported with the 1.0 release an the LiveCD functionality. These have not been corrected
            yet. We recommend installing MidnightBSD in a virtual machine to try it out before committing to dedicated
            hardware with it.

        <p>If you are updating an existing system, after installing 1.2,
            you can use mport upgrade to update packages with 1.2 versions. It is recommended that you delete
            /usr/mports/Packages and
            run mport clean to remove old package remnants.

        <p>You may use svnlite (part of the base system) to checkout mports or src, if you do not wish to install the
            svn package.

            <br>e.g.
            <br>cd /usr/ && svnlite co http://svn.midnightbsd.org/svn/mports/trunk mports
        </p>

        <p>mports moved to github and you can also use the git package to fetch updated mports with
        cd /usr/ && git clone https://github.com/midnightbsd/mports.git </p>

        <p>portsnap is also available in this release and can be used to update mports also.
        <br>first use:  portsnap fetch extract
        <br>then: portsnap fetch update
        </p>

        <p>See the man page for more information.</p>
