        <h3>(09/21/2021) MidnightBSD 2.1</h3>

        <p>I’m happy to announce the availability of MidnightBSD 2.1 for amd64 and i386.  This is an incremental release
            focusing on bug fixes, improvements to the package manager and a new system compiler.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>LLVM updated to 10.0.1</li>
            <li>mport 2.1.4</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Upgrade Process</h4>

        <p>Install git if you don’t have it already
        <code>mport install git</code>

        <p>Fetch MidnightBSD from git via github.com/midnightbsd/src.git   (assumes you don’t have /usr/src populated)

        <code>git clone https://github.com/MidnightBSD/src.git</code>

        <p>Checkout the stable/2.1 branch
        <code>git checkout stable/2.1</code>

        <code>cd /usr/src; make clean buildworld buildkernel;<br>
        mergemaster -p<br>
        make installkernel<br>
            reboot</code>
        <p>(if it works OK, login and go to /usr/src)<br>
            <code>
            make installworld<br>
        mergemaster -iU<br>
        cd /usr/src/usr.bin/perl; make; make install;
            </code>
        <p>
        Update installed mports/packages<br>
        <code>
        cd /usr/src/; make check-old;
                make delete-old
        </code>

        <h4>Bug Fixes and new features</h4>

        <p>The majority of improvements come from the MidnightBSD package manager, mport.  A number of longstanding
        bugs have been fixed.  It now can update dependencies properly on install, update or upgrade scenarios. Previously,
        it would sometimes crash and force the user to do it manually. Several fixes have been made around PLIST
        processing.</p>

        <p>mport now sets a character encoding so that extracting files with libarchive with special characters
        is more likely to work properly without a crash occurring. (lang/go port is a fun trigger of this bug)

        <p>libmport no
        long relies on libdispatch.  This is slower in a few scenarios, but most invocations are now faster as it doesn't need
        to setup the thread pools or do the locking it once did.  This makes sense as package installs have a lot of serial code
        paths. Also fixed many memory leaks as well as some use after free and invalid free calls against the wrong
        pointer.  We're now using sha256 for hashing plist entries installed.</p>

        <p>We now generate a os-release file on system startup in /var/run</p>

        <p>Fixed issue where looking at some man pages would cause man to crash in MidnightBSD.</p>

        <p>A bug in the firstboot script was corrected that referenced an invalid package name.

        <p>burncd was removed.

        <p>Fixed some temp file handling bugs</p>

        <p>Fixed some problems with libcxxrt and rtld in MidnightBSD that would cause strange problems with 32bit binaries.</p>

        <p>Fix the buggy mdnsd 'mdns' sed in the /etc/rc.d/mdnsd script that would often cause it to fail to modify /etc/nsswitch.conf on system startup
        as needed.</p>

        <p>libcasper(3) creates service processes by forking the calling process,
            so they initially inherit the calling process' file descriptor table.
            Casper services expect the lowest 3 file descriptors, traditionally
            corresponding to standard input, output, and error, are redirected to
            /dev/null.  libcasper(3) ensures this is the case.  However, it did not
            handle the possibility that one of them is closed, and this scenario
            would trigger an assertion failure during service creation, resulting in
            a crash.
        </p>

        <h4>Security Fixes</h4>

        <p>Apache Portable Runtime CVE workaround.  CVE-2021-35940</p>

        <p>A programming error in the Linux compatibility layer futex(2) system
            call might allow attackers to cause a denial of service.</p>

        <p>Certain VirtIO-based device models failed to handle errors when fetching
        I/O descriptors.  Such errors could be triggered by a malicious guest.
        As a result, the device model code could be tricked into operating on
        uninitialized I/O vectors, leading to memory corruption.

        <p>The ggatec(8) daemon does not validate the size of a response before writing
        it to a fixed-sized buffer.  This allows to overwrite the stack of ggatec(8).

        <p>The passive mode in FTP communication allows an out of boundary read while
        libfetch uses strtol to parse the relevant numbers into address bytes.  It
        does not check if the line ends prematurely.  If it does, the for-loop
        condition checks for *p == '\0' one byte too late because p++ was already
        performed.

        <p>A programming error in the Linux compatibility layer futex(2) system
        call might allow attackers to cause a denial of service.

        <p>libcasper(3) creates service processes by forking the calling process,
        so they initially inherit the calling process' file descriptor table.
        Casper services expect the lowest 3 file descriptors, traditionally
        corresponding to standard input, output, and error, are redirected to
        /dev/null.  libcasper(3) ensures this is the case.  However, it did not
        handle the possibility that one of them is closed, and this scenario
        would trigger an assertion failure during service creation, resulting in
        a crash.

        <p>A particular case of memory sharing is mishandled in the virtual memory system.  It is possible
        and legal to establish a relationship where multiple descendant processes share a mapping which
        shadows memory of an ancestor process.  In this scenario, when one process modifies memory
        through such a mapping, the copy-on-write logic fails to invalidate other mappings of the source
        page.  These stale mappings may remain even after the mapped pages have been reused for another purpose.

        <p>Due to a race condition between lookup of ".." and remounting a filesystem,
        a process running inside a jail might access filesystem hierarchy outside
        of jail.

        <p>Fix a security issue with pam.  The rules would not be applied correctly.

        <p>xen fix to unmap correctly when errors occur

        <p>Fix a extattr corruption bug with ufs

        <p>Uninitialized kernel stack leaks in several file systems

        <p>Xen guests can triger backend Out Of Memory

        <p>The root certificates of the Mozilla CA Certificate Store have been
        updated.

        <p>Fixed a security problem with zlib:<br>
        Handle case where inflateSync used when header never processed.
        If zlib and/or gzip header processing was requested, but a header
        was never provided and inflateSync was used successfully, then the
        inflate state would be inconsistent, trying to compute a check
        value but with no flags set. This commit sets the inflate mode to
        raw in this case, since there is no other assumption that can be
        made if a header was requested but never seen.</p>
