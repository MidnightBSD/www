        <h3>(11/13/2020) MidnightBSD 2.0</h3>

        <p>I’m happy to announce the availability of MidnightBSD 2.0 for amd64 and i386.  This is a massive release focusing on base system improvements.

        <p>We’ve imported many features from FreeBSD 11.x as part of the release.

        <ul>
        <li>LLVM updated to 8.0.1
        <li>ELF ToolChain updated
        <li>OpenSSL updated
        <li>ZFS now supports parallel mounting
        <li>Kernel logs jail IDs when a process exits
        <li>Network firmware updates
        </ul>

        <p>Updated DRM code is now in mports for 2.0 and later.  This allows us to update it outside of a release.

        <h4>Upgrade Process</h4>

        <p>Due to the nature of the release, there are a few minor build issues when upgrading from MidnightBSD 1.2.x by source.  Please follow this awkward procedure:
        <br>(you can also do this with svnlite using github)

        <p>Install git if you don’t have it already
        <code>mport install git</code>

        <p>Fetch MidnightBSD from git via github.com/midnightbsd/src.git   (assumes you don’t have /usr/src populated)

        <code>git clone https://github.com/MidnightBSD/src.git</code>

        <p>Checkout the stable/2.0 branch
        <code>git checkout stable/2.0</code>

        <p>Using your favorite editor (ee, vi, nano, gedit, … ) open the src/usr.bin/Makefile
        <p>Comment out with #
        <pre>
        .if defined(LINKER_FEATURES) && ${LINKER_FEATURES:Mfilter}
        SUBDIR= perl \
                .WAIT
        .endif
        </pre>
        
        <code>cd /usr/src; make clean buildworld buildkernel;<br>
        mergemaster -p<br>
        make installkernel<br>
            reboot</code>
        <p>(if it works OK, login and go to /usr/src)<br>
            <code>
            make installworld<br>
        mergemaster -iU<br>
        cd /usr/src/usr.bin/perl; make; make install;
            </code>
        <p>
        Open src/usr.bin/Makefile again and uncomment the previous lines (in case you do a rebuild later)<br>
        Update installed mports/packages<br>
        <code>
        cd /usr/src/; make check-old;
                make delete-old
        </code>

        <p>When you are done, verify that perl is updated by running perl -v
        You should have perl 5.32.0. If it says perl 5.28, be sure to upgrade perl!

        <p>The diskinfo(8) utility has been updated to display disk rotation rate and if TRIM/UNMAP is supported by the disk.
        <p>The rsh(1) utility has been updated to include a new flag, -N, which disables shutdown of a socket sending path when used.

        <p>The boot code and loader(8) have been updated to check for unsupported ZFS feature flags. If unsupported features are active, the pool is not considered as a bootable pool, and a diagnostic message is printed to the console

        <p>The length of GELI passphrases entered when booting a system with encrypted disks is now hidden by default.

        <p>The icmp6(4) protocol has been updated to fix ICMPv6 redirects.

        <p>The clang nullability qualifiers have been added to the C library headers.

        <p>Uses of the GNU __nonnull__ attribute have been replaced with the more benign Clang nullability attributes.

        <p>ptrace(2) now supports events for vfork(2), permitting reliable debugging across vfork(2) invocations

        <p>Process core dumps now include the process ID (PID) and command line arguments.

        <p>The ipfw(4) packet filter has been updated to add support for named dynamic states.

        <p>The ipfw_pmod kernel module has been added, designed for modifying packets of any protocol.

        <p>The vfs.root_mount_always_wait tunable has been added, which forces the kernel to wait for root mount holds even if the root device is already present.

        <p>When the system real time clock (RTC) is adjusted, such as by clock_settime(), sleeping threads are now awakened and absolute sleep times are reevaluated based on the new value of the RTC.

        <p>The network stack has been updated to include ip6_tryforward(), providing performance benefits as result of a reduced number of checks.
        <p>The network stack has been modified to fix incorrect or invalid IP addresses if multiple threads emit a UDP log_in_vain message concurrently.
        <p>The TCP stack has been changed to use the estimated RTT instead of timestamps for receive buffer auto resizing.

        <p>The default newsyslog.conf(5) now includes files in the /etc/newsyslog.conf.d/ and /usr/local/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/ directories for newsyslog(8)
        <p>The mailwrapper(8) utility has been updated to use mailer.conf(5) from the LOCALBASE environment variable, which defaults to /usr/local if unset
        <p>The pciconf(8) utility can now identify PCI devices that are attached to a driver to be identified by their device name instead of just the selector. Additionally, the -l flag now accepts an optional device argument to list details about a single device
        <p>A new flag, “onifconsole” has been added to /etc/ttys. This allows the system to provide a login prompt via serial console if the device is an active kernel console, otherwise it is equivalent to off.

        <p>Support for displaying VPD for PCI devices via pciconf(8) has been added.

        <p>The bsdconfig(8) utility has been updated to skip the initial tzsetup(8) UTC versus wall-clock time prompt when run in a virtual machine, determined when the kern.vm_guest sysctl(8) is set to 1.

        <h4>Security Fixes</h4>
        <p>The jail(8) utility has been updated to include a new jail.conf(5) parameter, allow.read_msgbuf, which prevents jailed processes and users from accessing the dmesg(8) buffer. This parameter is set to false by default.

        <p>A new variable, init_exec, has been added to kenv(1), allowing init(8) to run an executable file after opening the console, replacing init(8) as PID 1

        <p>The jail(8) utility has been updated to add a new flag, -e, which takes a jail.conf(5) parameter as an argument and prints a list of non-wildcard jails with the specified parameter.

        <p>The ping(8) utility has been updated to use the Capsicum framework to drop privileges, protecting against malicious network packets.

        <h4>Known Issues</h4>

        <p>UEFI issues with the amd64 ISO. We’re going to address these in the 2.0.1 release.

        <p>Upgrading perl from 1.2 is not working with buildworld.

        <p>Sometimes you’ll get an error with mandoc, just try reinstalling src/usr.bin/man if this is crashing. (rare build issue)

        <p>Mport package manager has 3 known issues:
        <ul>
        <li>Some PLIST files are causing issues with @() syntax in setting permissions when partially defined. A fix is coming in a later update for this.
        <li>mport deleteall is not catching all packages on the first pass. You may need to run it a few times.
        <li>mport upgrade or update paths are not always finding new dependencies.  Work is underway on this as well.
        </ul>
        
        <p>In some cases, you may get an error about updating /etc/nsswitch.conf at startup. This is an issue with the mdns related features. Either disable mDNSresponder or modify the hosts like to be
            <code>Hosts: files mdns dns</code>


        <p>There are two mports that are broken which are causing issues and will be the highest priority after the release:
        <ul>
        <li>Mono (amd64 and i386)
        <li>tex-formats (i386 only)
        </ul>
