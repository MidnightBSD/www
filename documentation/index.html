				<h3 id="s1a">Installation</h3>
				<h4 id="s1b">Introduction</h4>
				<p>While MidnightBSD plans to target moderate and novice users, currently installation 
				is too difficult for beginners to *NIX like operating systems. Experience with BSD, 
				Linux, or another *NIX like system is very helpful. FreeBSD users familiar with 
				bsdinstall should have no problem with this procedure. You may also consult the <a href="https://github.com/MidnightBSD/src/wiki">MidnightBSD Wiki</a> or
				<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook">FreeBSD Handbook</a> for additional information 
				not found on this page.</p>
				
				<h4 id="s1c">Preparing For Installation</h4>
				<p>You may download MidnightBSD from our FTP server or any mirrors, provided that you have a
				broadband internet connection. You will need disk 1 of a release in order to install MidnightBSD.</p>
				<p>You will need free space on your hard drive. While the system runs very well on a few gigabytes of disk space, we recommend at least 
				15GB of space for use with mports on a desktop. An Intel Pentium class computer or equivalent is required. We have removed 486 support 
				from the default install, although it can be compiled in. At least 96MB of RAM is required for installation.</p>
				<p>Depending on your needs, various graphics cards are supported at different levels. Many network cards are
				supported as well as a few wireless network cards. We will document them at a later time.
				Many onboard audio controllers are supported as well as other cards like the 
				Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy and Audigy 2 families.</p>

				<h5>UEFI</h5>
				<p>MidnightBSD can co-exist with Microsoft Windows or Linux on the same disk.  The approach will vary depending on your system using
				UEFI or legacy BIOS.  With UEFI, one can use GRUB 2, the Windows built in manager (with customization), or rEFInd (recommended). reFFInd is ideal for supporting
				Microsoft Windows and MidnightBSD dual boot.</p>

				<h5>Legacy BIOS</h5>
				<p>For legacy BIOS, it is recommended that you use GRUB from Linux if you wish to dual boot MidnightBSD with Linux.
				For Windows XP, the included boot manager is sufficient. Third party boot managers such as GAG or System Commander 8.20+ are supported as well. I used to dual boot
				Windows XP SP2 and MidnightBSD with System Commander on my primary desktop.  With Windows Vista,
				you should use the boot manager included with Vista (and the boot1 file from CD) 
				or a third party boot manager such as GAG.  The included one with not work with Vista (overwrites it)</p>
				<p>You may also install MidnightBSD using a virtualization product such as VMWare Workstation, VMWare ESXi, VirtualBox, Parallels, qemu, or Microsoft Virtual PC.</p>

				<h5>Installation Media Preparation</h5>
				<p>You will need to burn a copy of the Disk 1 iso from our FTP server using your
				favorite CD burning software. If you need to download burning software, 
				<a href="http://www.maconnect.ch/index.php?page=liquidcd&amp;lang=en">LiquidCD</a> for Mac OS X, and 
				<a href="http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net/">InfraRecorder</a> for Windows XP are both free and easy to use.
				Also, on OS X, you can burn with Disk Utility.  For FreeBSD 9.x or MidnightBSD 1.2 or earlier, you can
				use burncd (part of os).

				<p>With the <b>USB flash image</b>, you can install on macOS or Windows 10+ with <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">etcher</a> or by using
				dd on macOS/Linux/BSD with <code>sudo dd if=imagefilename of=/dev/yourusbdev</code>
				</p>

				<h4 id="s1d">Installing MidnightBSD</h4>

				<p>There is a YouTube video covering installation available: <a href="https://youtu.be/HpSEx6ICHrw">Installing MidnightBSD 2.0</a>
				2.0 and higher have similar installation procedures.</p>

				<p>Insert the MidnightBSD USB flash drive or CD into your CD-ROM drive and start up your PC. On some
				systems, you may need to enter the BIOS to enable booting from the flash media or CD-ROM drive first.
				On some systems, there is a button you can push to select the CD-ROM drive. For instance, 
				on some Dell systems you can press F12 and then pick the CD-ROM drive. F11 is also common for the boot manager.
				</p>

				<p>You should see a red and blue screen come up after a few moments preceded by a lot
				of white and black text. If several minutes pass with no activity, and you do not see
				this screen, please report it. There maybe a bug or an incompatibility with your 
				system we can work to fix.
				</p>

				<p>From this point, you may follow the steps in bsdinstall to complete installation.
				</p>

				<p>If you are interested in legacy releases, you  may follow along with the BSD Magazine article on
				<a href="http://bsdmag.org/download/bsd-2010-archives/">installing MidnightBSD.</a> in the August 2010 issue.
					This procedure covers 0.1-RELEASE - 0.3-RELEASE. 0.4 installation is a bit different.
					There are also some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caZ2KpLehW4">YouTube videos</a> available for older releases.</p>


				<h4 id="s1e">Example Hardware Configurations</h4>

				<p>You can check out <a href="https://bsd-hardware.info/?d=MidnightBSD">BSD Hardware</a> for a list of some systems
				running MidnightBSD, including details on what is detected.</p>

				<p>Here is a list of systems that MidnightBSD has been tested on.</p>

				<p>In general, if hardware worked in FreeBSD 6.0 Release it will most likely work in MidnightBSD. 
				Some drivers were imported from FreeBSD 6.1 beta, 6.1 Release and 6.2.  0.3-CURRENT
				includes drivers from FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE. We've also added support for several other systems such as network cards found in Intel based iMacs, newer AMD, Intel and NVIDIA SATA chipsets, and fixes for Apple mice.</p>	

				<h4 id="s1f">Updating the Operating System</h4>
                                <p>Currently, the only method to update the OS core libraries is through use of the subversion tool.  MidnightBSD 0.6 and higher include
				the svnlite command as part of the base system. You may checkout the updated source code from the stable branch of the release and build it.
				Detailed instructions are available in the <a href="../developer/">developer section</a> of the website.</p>
				<p>We plan to add binary update capability to the mport tools. This work has not yet started.</p>
				<p>Packages may be updated with the mport update or mport upgrade commands. The latter will update all installed packages whereas the former can be
				used to update individual packages.</p>
