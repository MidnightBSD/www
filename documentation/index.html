				<h3 id="s1a">Installation</h3>
				<h4 id="s1b">Introduction</h4>
				<p>While MidnightBSD plans to target moderate and novice users, currently installation 
				is too difficult for beginners to *NIX like operating systems. Experience with BSD, 
				Linux, or another *NIX like system is very helpful. FreeBSD users familiar with 
				sysinstall should have no problem with this procedure. You may also consult the
				<a href="/wiki/">MidnightBSD wiki</a> or 
				<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook">FreeBSD Handbook</a> for additional information 
				not found on this page.</p>
				
				<h4 id="s1c">Preparing For Installation</h4>
				<p>You may download MidnightBSD from our FTP server or any mirrors, provided that you have cable or
				<a href="http://broadband.o2.co.uk/">broadband</a> internet connection. You will need disk 1 of a release or snapshot in order to install MidnightBSD.</p>
				<p>You will need free space on your hard drive. While the system runs very well on a few gigabytes of disk space, we recommend at least 
				15GB of space for use with mports on a desktop. An Intel Pentium class computer or equivalent is required. We have removed 486 support 
				from the default install, although it can be compiled in. At least 48MB of RAM is required for installation.</p>
				<p>Depending on your needs, various graphics cards are supported at different levels. Many network cards are
				supported as well as a few wireless network cards. We will document them at a later time.
				Many onboard audio controllers are supported as well as other cards like the 
				Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy and Audigy 2 families.</p>
				<p>MidnightBSD can co-exist with Microsoft Windows or Linux on the same disk. It is 
				recommended that you use GRUB from Linux if you wish to dual boot MidnightBSD with Linux. 
				For Windows, the included boot manager is sufficient. (Windows XP was tested). Third
				party boot managers such as System Commander 8.20 are supported as well. I currently dual boot 
				Windows XP SP2 and MidnightBSD with System Commander on my primary desktop.  With Windows Vista,
				you should use the boot manager included with Vista (and the boot1 file from CD) 
				or a third party boot manager such as gag.  The included one with not work with Vista (overwrites it)</p>
				<p>You may also install MidnightBSD using a virtualization product such as qemu, Microsoft Virtual PC, or VMware. Parallels has not been tested to my knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>You will need to burn a copy of the Disk 1 iso from our FTP server using your favorite CD burning software. If you need to download burning software, <a href="http://www.maconnect.ch/index.php?page=liquidcd&lang=en">LiquidCD</a> for Mac OS X, and <a href="http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net/">InfraRecorder</a> for Windows XP are both free and easy to use.
				</p>
				<h4 id="s1d">Installing MidnightBSD</h4>
				<p>Insert the MidnightBSD CD into your CD-ROM drive and start up your PC. On some systems, you may need to enter the BIOS to enable booting from the CD-ROM drive first. On some systems, there is a button you can push to select the CD-ROM drive. For instance, on some Dell systems you can press F12 and then pick the CD-ROM drive.
				</p>
				<p>You should see a red and blue screen come up after a few moments preceded by a lot of white and black text. If several minutes pass with no activity and you do not see this screen, please report it. There maybe a bug or an incompatibility with your system we can work to fix.
				</p>
				<p>From this point, you may follow the steps in sysinstall to complete installation. On snapshots, X11 (XORG) and packages are not present. Do not attempt to install these items or you will receive errors. We hope to resolve this by 0.2 release.
				</p>
				<h4 id="s1e">Example Hardware Configurations</h4>
				<p>Here is a list of systems that MidnightBSD has been tested on.</p>

							upgraded to an ATI X1900 GT PCIe, that works with X11 using radeonhd (2D only)</td>
						</tr>
			        	<tr>
							<td>Virtual PC</td>
							<td>Works</td>
							<td>Virtual PC for Windows works as expected. VPC 7 for Mac OS X works except the CDROM drive is "lost" during install. If you can get it installed using ftp install, 
							it will work fine. Note, you must install 0.1.1 from FTP and then upgrade to 0.2 as sysinstall FTP installation is broken in 0.2.1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>VMware</td>
							<td>Works</td>
							<td>VMware player works under Windows Vista or XP. VMware Fusion on Mac OS X runs MidnightBSD as expected. Unable to install the vmware-tools for better performance.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Sun Netra T1</td>
							<td>Works</td>
							<td>You must use the 0.1 snap and then update to 0.2.1 release.  We want to support these again come 0.3. One is a T1 105. Systems have 512MB and 768MB RAM,
							SCSI disks, one has an IDE cdrom drive.  Onboard NICs work.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>

						    wifi.  Using ndis with a broadcom wireless NIC works.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>

				<p>In general, if hardware worked in FreeBSD 6.0 Release it will most likely work in MidnightBSD. Some drivers were imported from FreeBSD 6.1 beta, 6.1 Release and 6.2.</p>
